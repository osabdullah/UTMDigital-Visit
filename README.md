# UTMDigital-Visit

Our class had the chance to take advantage of an extensive, one-hour tour of UTM Digital on December 6th. It was a really illuminating event that gave us a close-up view of the workings of a support team. I gained knowledge about the various degrees of difficulty of the problems they address, the value of collaboration, and how they approach brainstorming in their meeting rooms. For me, entering the server room for the first time was the most exciting aspect. It was a revelation to witness a server in action after years of studying about them. It made it possible for me to have a close-up understanding of the functional components of server security, data storage, network connectivity, and environmental controls. This excursion was immensely valuable for us students, sparking a keen interest to further explore and understand the intricacies of network and server technologies.
